# SUPER

From Fall 2024 to Spring 2025 I participated in the SUPER program, which is a research program dedicated to undergraduates. In my project, I worked with Dr. Jody Vogeler to train a model that can identify tree status based on remote imagery.

# Quantitative Reasoning

In the Spring of 2025 I took a class Quantitative Reasoning class based **in** R. I wrote some code, and did some cool data science. Here is a collection of links!

-   In this assignment we built a static users site with Github Pages
-   Includes a github repo **for** access to all the code.
-   Look at how high quality my work is!
